-- Part 1: SQL queries to retrieve animation movies

-- -- -- -- -- -- TASK 1.1 -- -- -- -- -- --
-- Task: Find all animation movies:
-- 1. Released between 2017-2019 (inclusive)
-- 2. Rental rate > $1
-- 3. Category must be 'Animation'
-- 4. Results should be alphabetically sorted by title
-- 5. Only need to display the title

-- Solution 1: Using standard INNER JOINs
-- This solution efficiently retrieves animation movie titles using JOINs to link 
-- the relevant tables while ensuring that all filters are applied directly in the query.
SELECT f.title
FROM category AS cat 
INNER JOIN film_category AS fc ON cat.category_id = fc.category_id  -- Join to link categories with films
INNER JOIN film AS f ON f.film_id = fc.film_id  -- Join to link films with their categories
WHERE f.release_year BETWEEN 2017 AND 2019  -- Filter for the specified release years
      AND f.rental_rate > 1  -- Filter for rental rates greater than $1
      AND cat.name = 'Animation'  -- Ensure the category is 'Animation'
ORDER BY f.title ASC;  -- Sort results alphabetically by title

-- Solution 2: Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
-- This solution uses a CTE to first isolate the 'Animation' category, improving readability
-- and separation of concerns before performing the final filtering and retrieval of titles.
WITH animation_films AS (
    SELECT fc.film_id
    FROM category AS cat
    INNER JOIN film_category AS fc ON cat.category_id = fc.category_id  -- Join to link categories with films
    WHERE cat.name = 'Animation'  -- Filter for 'Animation' category
)
SELECT f.title
FROM film AS f
INNER JOIN animation_films AS af ON f.film_id = af.film_id  -- Join to get film titles from CTE
WHERE f.release_year BETWEEN 2017 AND 2019  -- Filter for the specified release years
      AND f.rental_rate > 1  -- Filter for rental rates greater than $1
ORDER BY f.title ASC;  -- Sort results alphabetically by title

-- Solution 3: Using EXISTS clause
-- This solution demonstrates an alternative approach by using EXISTS clauses to check for 
-- the presence of the 'Animation' category, allowing for flexible and logical filtering.
SELECT f.title
FROM film AS f
WHERE EXISTS (  -- Check for existence of a matching category
    SELECT 1
    FROM film_category AS fc
    WHERE fc.film_id = f.film_id  -- Match film IDs
      AND fc.category_id IN (  -- Filter for categories that match 'Animation'
          SELECT category_id
          FROM category AS cat
          WHERE cat.name = 'Animation'  -- Ensure the category is 'Animation'
      )
)
AND f.release_year BETWEEN 2017 AND 2019  -- Filter for the specified release years
AND f.rental_rate > 1  -- Filter for rental rates greater than $1
ORDER BY f.title ASC;  -- Sort results alphabetically by title


-- Best Solution is 2 (Using CTE).
-- Using a CTE to pre-filter movies by category ("Animation") improves clarity by separating filtering logic, 
-- making it easier to understand and maintain without affecting performance significantly.

-- Task: Calculate revenue earned by each rental store since March 2017
-- Business Logic Interpretation:

-- 2. Calculate total revenue from payments
-- 3. Only include rentals from March 2017 onwards
-- 4. Group results by store location
-- 5. Address2 is optional (handle NULL values)

-- Solution 1: Using CTE to separate address and revenue calculations
-- This solution separates address construction and revenue calculation into CTEs,
-- improving clarity and allowing for modular queries. It also handles NULL values
-- for address2 using COALESCE.
WITH store_addresses AS (
   SELECT

   sr.revenue  -- Select revenue from store_revenue CTE
FROM store_addresses AS sa
INNER JOIN store_revenue AS sr ON sr.store_id = sa.store_id;  -- Join the two CTEs on store ID

-- Solution 2: Using subqueries
-- This solution employs subqueries to retrieve both the address and the revenue.
-- Itâ€™s a more straightforward approach, though it may be less efficient than using CTEs.
SELECT 
   (SELECT ad.address || ' ' || COALESCE(ad.address2, '')  -- Combine address and address2, handling NULL
    FROM address AS ad

    AND r.rental_date >= '2017-03-01') AS revenue  -- Filter for rentals since March 2017
FROM store AS st;  -- Main query on the store table

-- Solution 3: Using window functions
-- This solution demonstrates a method using window functions to calculate revenue
-- and get addresses, but it violates the requirement of not using window functions.
-- Hence, we won't use this solution as per your constraints.
SELECT DISTINCT
   ad.address || ' ' || COALESCE(ad.address2, '') AS addresses,  -- Combine address and address2, handling NULL
   SUM(pay.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY st.store_id) AS revenue  -- Calculate revenue using window function (not allowed as per requirements)
FROM payment AS pay

INNER JOIN staff AS s ON s.staff_id = r.staff_id  -- INNER JOIN to connect rentals with staff/store
INNER JOIN store AS st ON st.store_id = s.store_id  -- INNER JOIN to link stores
INNER JOIN address AS ad ON ad.address_id = st.address_id  -- INNER JOIN to get addresses
WHERE r.rental_date >= '2017-03-01';  -- Filter for rentals since March 2017



-- In Solution 1.2, the filter on the category is moved to a Common Table Expression (CTE) to improve readability and modularity.
--  By isolating 'Animation' films in the animation_films CTE, it makes the main query more straightforward, 
--  as it no longer has to filter by category in each JOIN. This approach also provides a modular way to manage complex queries, 
--  breaking down filtering steps into smaller, manageable pieces.


-- Best Solution is 1 (Using CTE).
-- The CTEs modularize address construction and revenue calculation, enhancing readability while efficiently managing large datasets.
--  Handling NULL values in address2 via COALESCE ensures robustness, and separating the data retrieval stages does not significantly impact performance compared to other solutions.

-- Task: Top-5 actors by number of movies (released since 2015)
-- (Columns: first_name, last_name, number_of_movies, sorted by number_of_movies in descending order)

-- Business Logic Interpretation:
-- The goal is to identify the top 5 actors who have been in the most movies since 2015.
-- This involves:
-- 1. Filtering the films to include only those released from 2015 onward.

-- 3. Grouping results by actor to ensure accurate counting.
-- 4. Sorting the actors based on their movie count in descending order to highlight the most prolific actors.
-- 5. Limiting the results to the top 5 actors for concise output.

-- Solution 1: Using standard JOINs
-- This approach directly joins the actor, film_actor, and film tables.
-- It counts the number of movies for each actor released since 2015.
-- The results are grouped by the actor's first and last name and sorted to show the top 5.

-- In Solution 1.3, the subquery for counting movies per actor runs once per actor in the SELECT list. 
-- Therefore, for each unique actor in the main query's result set, the subquery counts the actor's movies released since 2015.
--  This results in the subquery being executed multiple timesâ€”one for each actor in the actor table that meets the condition.

-- Best Solution is 2 (Using CTE).
-- Using a CTE to pre-calculate the movie count for each actor simplifies the query structure, 
-- isolating counting logic and making the main query focused on retrieving the top 5 actors.
--  It performs well with complex aggregation tasks, as the CTE minimizes redundant calculations.

-- Task: Find actors/actresses with the shortest gap in acting roles based on the latest release year of their films.
-- Business Logic Interpretation:
-- 1. Calculate the gap between the latest release year of films for each actor and the current year.
-- 2. Sort results by the gap in ascending order to identify actors with the shortest gap since their last role.
-- V1: gap between the latest release_year and current year per each actor;
-- Solution: Using standard JOINs with aggregation

-- It organizes films in order, making it easy to calculate gaps without complex joins or subqueries,
